# CSCI115ShortestPath
Project for class using dijkstra shortest path algorithm and midpoint algorithm for terrain generation.

Implementation by Rogelio Romero
using framework created by Dr. Dhanyu Amarasinghe

========================================================================================================

TERRAIN GENERATION
-In Main.cpp

-Midpoint Algorithm will generate terrain for an (N^2)+1 size grid. (i.e 5x5, 10x10)

-Using %120 and a range for values for each element that will be placed on the map,
a map will be randomly created and saved to a text file "terrain.txt"

Key guide for elements:
"O" = Ocean
"B" = Beach
"D" = Desert
"F" = Forest
"P" = Plain
"H" = Foothills
"M" = Middle Mountain
"T" = High Mountain

-terrain.txt file may have more elements than what desired grid may hold.
values will be taken starting from top left corner and proceed down and right.
(e.g top-left corner will be (0,gridsize-1).

-Initialized by calling M->generateTerrain() in main.cpp;

CHARACTERS

FISH
-The fish will spawn in an ocean space not occupied by any other character 
-The fish can move to the ocean and the beach

HUMAN
-The human will spawn in a space that is not High Mountain or Ocean and not occupied by any other character
-The human can move to any other space besides high mountain and ocean

BIRD
-The bird will spawn in a space that is not desert and is not occupied by any other character
-The bird can move to any other space desides desert and can fly over high mountains (low movement cost in mountain areas)

Frog
-The frog will spawn in a space that is not a moountain or desert
-The frog can move to any other space desides mountain or desert.

-All characters will try to avoid the spaces that they cannot move to (unpassable boundaries not yet implemented)
-All characters cannot move to a space occupied by another character and will move around them.
-If the destination space is occupied by another character, the program will crash, this is intentional behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOVEMENT

-Left click on a character to select that character (Due to grid issues, click on top right corner for proper click tracking)
-Right click on a empty grid space to move to that grid space.
-wait until movement ends. Clicking on a different character will continue the previous character's movement for the new character clicked

-Shortest path calculated using Djikstra's algorithm.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO-DO

-Create Boundaries for inaccessable areas (current have an edge value of 1000 so that character will try to avoid them)
-create features in terrain (such as tunnels in mountains, etc)
-Replace branching if-elseif tree for edge value calculation with a more efficient data structure
-Replace crashing of program when trying to move to occupied tile with something more rational.
-Refactoring
